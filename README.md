# 🌙 Hi, I'm Zeph!
Welcome to my GitHub profile; thank you for checking it out!

## 💫 About Me
Here is a summary of who I am and what I can do:

### ✨ General
I've had way too much spare time during my childhood and used it to
learn the most random of things, from balisong flipping to musical composition.

Other hobbies I have include:
- 🎹 Piano
- 🎸 Guitar
- 🎼 Musical production
- 📸 Photography
- 🎬 Video editing
- 🎮 Gaming
- 🏋️‍♂️ Working out

## 🌟 Programming
I'm more of a "jolly" in coding, meaning I code just about anything, 
from backends to frontends, from Windows, iOS or Android client apps to
games. Most of the times, I'm able to make whatever I put my mind to.

### ☄️ Skills
I'm best at **Python**, **JS/TS**, **C#**, **Rust** and **C/C++**, but I also know a bit of 
*Java*, *Swift* and *Visual Basic* (it's what I started coding with).

I've also gotten into DevOps and software deployment, learning CI/CD pipelines
with GitHub Actions, and managing/deploying infrastructures with Terraform, Docker and/or Kubernetes.
