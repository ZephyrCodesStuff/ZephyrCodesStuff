# 🌙 Hi, I'm Zeph!
Welcome to my GitHub profile; thank you for checking it out!
## 💫 About Me
Here is a summary of who I am and what I can do:

### ✨ General
I'm a 16 years old boy (*he/him*) who lives in Italy, had way too much spare time
during his childhood and used it to learn the most random of things,
from balisong flipping to musical composition.

Other hobbies I have include:
- 🎹 Piano
- 🎸 Guitar
- 🎼 Musical production
- 📸 Photography
- 🎬 Video editing

## 🌟 Programming
I'm more of a "jolly" in coding, meaning I code just about anything, 
from backends to frontends, from Windows, iOS or Android client apps to
games. Most of the times, I'm able to make whatever I put my mind to.
### ☄️ Skills
I'm best at **Python**, **C#**, **Kotlin** and **Rust**, but I also know a bit of 
*C++*, *Java*, *JavaScript*, *Swift* and *Visual Basic* (it's what I started coding with).
